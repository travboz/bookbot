# bookbot

A small project created while following the [bootdev](https://www.boot.dev/), "Build A Bookbot" course.

### Using this program
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the main directory: `bookbot/`
3. Use the command `python3 main.py` to receive report for `books/frankenstein.txt`
4. If you'd like to generate reports for different texts, create a `.txt` file containing all the book text and save it in the `books/` directory
5. Update the `book_path = "books/frankenstein.txt"` variable with the new relative path
6. Rerun `python3 main.py` to receive report.
